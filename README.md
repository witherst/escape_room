# Escape Room Game Text Adventure

The theme of this game is that a player goes to an escape room thinking it’ll be just for fun, but it turns out to be run by a psychopath who has booby trapped each room. Each room has at least one door leading to another room and each door has a puzzle to unlock it. If the user doesn’t figure out the puzzle, something horrible happens to them.
